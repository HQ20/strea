# tobalaba

The ewf network.

## Installation

### Requirements
* browser which supports metamask

## Usage

Since it's ethereum based, will not be much different than any other ethereum network.

Open metamask and add a new network with the address `https://tobalaba-rpc.slock.it` and then we need to use an account with ETH. To do so, we will import one account to metamask using a *.json* file. Will be provided in another way.

After this, you're ready, no need to do anything else.
